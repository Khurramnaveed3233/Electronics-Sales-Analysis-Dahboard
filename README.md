## 🛠️ Solution Section (Tools & Techniques)  

### 📊 Tools Used  
- **Power BI** (Dashboard creation, interactive visuals)  
- **Power Query** (Data cleaning & transformation)  
- **DAX** (Calculated measures like YoY growth, revenue bins)  
- **SQL** (Hypothetical queries for data extraction & aggregation)

--- 

### 📂 Example SQL Queries (Hypothetical)  

#### 1. Monthly Revenue Trends  
```sql
SELECT 
    Month, 
    SUM(Revenue) AS Total_Revenue

## 🚧 Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. Data Cleaning & Standardization
- **Issue:** Inconsistent region names (e.g., "North" vs. "Northern")  
- **Solution:** Used Power Query to standardize categories  

### 2. Revenue Binning for Segmentation  
- **Issue:** Needed to categorize transactions into high/medium/low revenue bins  
- **Solution:** Applied DAX measures to dynamically group revenue ranges  

### 3. Identifying Seasonal Trends  
- **Issue:** Needed to distinguish between random fluctuations and true seasonality  
- **Solution:** Used 12-month trend analysis to confirm December & June peaks  

### 4. Handling Missing Data  
- **Issue:** Some customer records had missing regions  
- **Solution:** Applied COALESCE in SQL (hypothetical) to fill gaps with "Unknown"
